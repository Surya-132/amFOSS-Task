This took a while since I did not have any experience in game/app development.
I had to watch about 2hrs of tutorials before I could do anything that worked.
Due to some issues with Ubuntu, I ran and developed this in VS code in windows. 
I am still not able to resolve the issues with not being able to run it on the VS code in Ubuntu but it runs perfectly on the VS code in Windows.
