Googled which libraries would be good for conversion of image to a string and found that pytesseract is a good one. 
Watched a tutorial on how to use it and its basic methods. Pillow is used so that we can open the image.
Used a pytesseract method to convert the image to a string and used eval() to print the result.
This method can only be used for "simple" arithmetic problems as mentioned in the question.
