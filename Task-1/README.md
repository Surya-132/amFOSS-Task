Cloned the repository and made the file named codes.

Part 1
Just googled the first perfect number (x=6) and solved the equation y=2x-7 and ran the spell using "python3 < name >.py".

Part 2
Also googled my way through and found x and y and ran the spell.

Part 3
Found out that it was a Bogart and googled the spell.
Used the "git checkout" command to change the relative path of the file.

Part 4
Used the "git log < branch name >" command and got the last code.
